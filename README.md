Salemgram
====================

Salemgram is a quick app that shows instagram photos tagged #SalemIs. Built with Node.js, Socket.io and AngularJS.

Plan eventually is to add a database of some kind, or just give up and use Flask or Django.

Basically an outright theft of [InstaO](https://github.com/dailyemerald/instaO), but with much cruder tools.
